      <description>Praat is widely used in phonetic research. Working with Praat involves inevitably the Praat scripting. There are plenty of resources of Praat scripts as well as great tutorials to Praat scripting (see below). Why bother writing Praat scripts oneself?
Praat scripts written by others can be helpful, but even an script is available which offer the functionality one needs, it is seldom exactly what one wants. It is normal to do some tailoring to the scripts.</description>
